# Goals

> Develop a few examples (not too complex) using asynchronous constructs and try to implement these examples in the two variants: using the current implementation of futures based on monadic constructs and the style that adopts gears (direct style).
Analyze aspects such as: 
> - ergonomicity of the two styles (which one results more thoughtful and/or verbose)
> - which of the two approaches has a real advantage in adoption, and when
> - Pros and cons of the two styles
> - how and when to use one approach rather than the other 
> - any limitations and difficulties encountered in using them
