# Direct style for Functional Reactive Programming: an analysis in Scala & Kotlin

## Goals of the project

> Develop a few examples (not too complex) using asynchronous constructs and try to implement these examples in the two variants: using the current implementation of futures based on monadic constructs and the style that adopts gears (direct style).
Analyze aspects such as:
>
> - ergonomicity of the two styles (which one results more thoughtful and/or verbose)
> - which of the two approaches has a real advantage in adoption, and when
> - Pros and cons of the two styles
> - how and when to use one approach rather than the other 
> - any limitations and difficulties encountered in using them

## Roadmap

1. [Boundary and break](./docs/01-boundaries)
2. [Blog posts service example: a direct-style vs monadic comparison](./docs/02-blog-posts-service)

TBD
