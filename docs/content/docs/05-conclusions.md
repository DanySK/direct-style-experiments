# Conclusions and Final Considerations

In conclusion, this project analyzed the main direct asynchronous programming abstractions offered by Kotlin's Coroutines and Scala's new, still entirely experimental library proposal, Gears.
During the analysis, input was also provided for its possible extension where it was deemed lacking compared to the Kotlin Coroutines framework.

Despite being a very young project, created for experimenting with direct style in Scala, it already offers a good set of abstractions for asynchronous programming, and seems to be promising for the future.

In general, the direct style is a very interesting approach and it is worth exploring further in the context of asynchronous programming, where it can offer a more natural and intuitive way to handle concurrency with respect to monadic transformations, which require a more complex model to be fully understood and grasped.
