# Going further and conclusions

## Recap

- `Channel`s are the basic communication primitive for exchanging data between `Future`s/`Coroutines` and they are primarily used to model data sources that are *intrinsically hot*, i.e. 
- `Flow`s are control structures, containing executable code. When we call the `collect` method we invoke the code inside the flow, like executing function's code by calling it. 

## Conclusions and Final Considerations

To conclude, in this project, the main direct-style asynchronous programming abstractions offered by the Kotlin Coroutines and Scala's new, still entirely experimental library proposal, Gears, were analyzed.
During the analysis, input was also provided for its possible extension where it was deemed lacking compared to the Kotlin framework.
